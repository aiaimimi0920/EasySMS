# Root Host Deploy Script Standard

This repository must preserve a repository-root deployment entrypoint named:

- `deploy-host.ps1`

The contract for that file is:

1. It must be a single-file operator entrypoint.
2. It must remain usable even when an operator downloads only this one file
   from GitHub.
3. It must not require the operator to manually clone or checkout the full
   repository before the first run.
4. If the local repository layout is missing, the script must bootstrap a
   local repo cache automatically before invoking any canonical internal
   deploy scripts.
5. If the full repository is already present, the script should fast-path to
   the local checkout instead of downloading another copy.
6. README deployment examples must point operators at `deploy-host.ps1`
   first, not at a deeper helper script.
7. The single-file entrypoint may delegate to repository-local scripts only
   after it has ensured the required repo files are present locally.
8. When the product supports blank-host deployment from GHCR or import-code
   style bootstrap, the root script should prefer that path over local-image
   shortcuts.
9. The script must expose at least one no-side-effect self-check mode such as
   `-ResolveRepoOnly`, so future maintainers can verify the bootstrap path
   without launching the runtime.

## Import Code Distribution

The canonical EasySms operator path now preserves all of these rules:

- the release workflow uploads a service/base runtime manifest to Cloudflare R2
- the release workflow also emits an encrypted owner import-code artifact
- `deploy-host.ps1` accepts either `-ImportCode` or `-BootstrapFile`
- the root entrypoint consumes that import-code/bootstrap path directly
- the import-code/bootstrap bundle contains R2 location data, manifest/object
  keys, read credentials, and sync metadata
- the owner private key input may be either:
  - a raw base64url Curve25519 private key
  - or a stable passphrase string that deterministically derives the same key

The corresponding public key can be derived locally with:

- `python scripts/easysms-import-code.py derive-public-key --private-key-file <owner-private-key.txt>`

## Canonical Docker Naming

This repo must keep the short slug `easy-sms` as the operator-facing default
for:

- Docker Compose project name
- default container name
- default network alias
- default local image name `easy-sms/easy-sms-service:local`
